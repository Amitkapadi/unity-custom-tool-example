# unity-custom-tool-example
This is sample code that shows many of the facets of creating custom tools for the Unity Editor.

The tool allows users to place primitive objects in the scene. Users can configure the object's shape, size, and color.

It's still a work in progress, but when complete it will provide examples for the following:

* Saving Persistent Data
 * Editor Preferences 
 * Project Specific Preferences
 * Shared Data for teams
* Editor Scripting
 * Drawing and handling common GUI elements with GUILayout and EditorGUILayout
 * GUILayout groups like Horizontal / Vertical layouts
 * Disabled GUI elements
* Creating and managing ScriptableObjects
